Sales Agentic Insights Dashboard

This is a Streamlit-based data visualization platform that uses an **Agentic Workflow** powered by Google Gemini (via `google-genai`). The system doesn't just create a chart; it drafts an initial visualization and then performs a **Self-Critique** to refine the code for better aesthetics and clarity.

## 🚀 Features
* **Automated Data Processing**: Upload any CSV (optimized for coffee sales data) to get instant summaries.
* **Agentic Refinement**: Two-step workflow (Draft -> Critique -> Refined) for higher quality charts.
* **Side-by-Side Comparison**: View the initial draft and the refined version simultaneously.
* **Code Transparency**: View the exact Python code generated by the AI agent.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit dashboard interface.
- `utilities/`:
    - `agent_workflow.py`: Contains the logic for the Draft and Refine cycle.
    - `llm_client.py`: Wrapper for the Gemini 2.0 Flash API.
    - `data_processor.py`: Handles data cleaning and prompt generation.
- `visualizations/`: Storage for the generated V1 and V2 plot images.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/andohrinne-sudo/agentic-viz-project.git](https://github.com/andohrinne-sudo/agentic-viz-project.git)
   cd agentic-viz-project

```

2. **Set up your API Key**:
Obtain a Google Gemini API key and set it in your environment:
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_actual_key_here"

```


3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


4. **Run the application**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py

```



## 🤖 How the Agent Works

1. **The Draft (V1)**: The agent analyzes your data structure and creates a baseline chart based on your prompt.
2. **The Critique (V2)**: A second pass where the agent reviews its own code to improve labeling, color palettes, and data handling robustness.
